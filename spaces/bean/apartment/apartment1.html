                   The next thing to consider is the length of your workouts. Really, 40 minutes, three to six times a week is
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    enough. As is three to five 1 hour sessions, or five to six 30 minutes sessions. The point is, there are a lot of
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    different ways you can structure your workouts. But in terms of frequency, if you're putting in 6-7 days of work

                    each week and not seeing results, you may benefits from adding in a day or two of rest or very light <a href="#" class="demi">recovery
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    workouts</a>(such as walking or stretching). Duration also matters; if you're working out for an hour or more, 5

                    times a week, and not seeing results, either your intensity, training type, or duration may be slowing or

                  Would you believe that eating <a href="#" class="demi">eating too little may actually cause weight gain</a>? Like the other items on this list, it's 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">

                  your body to become more likely to stubbornly hold onto fat, potentially slowing your metabolism - which can
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  cause grief in both the short and long term. What's the fix? Similar to the advice in point #1 in this article; focus
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  on eating for good health, for energy and to feel good. If you need to make smart food choices and listening to

                  Again, I realize that in the beginning, a lot of us may need a guideline or something to follow and use to learn
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    healthy habits. And there may be times in our lives when we may even need to reassess what was previously

                      working for us, but is no longer serving us. It's important we stay aware of these things. But overall, <em>the end
