              <br class="hidden-xs">
             that we eat. We don't skip meals, and in fact we usually eat in between meals. For times when life
             <br class="hidden-xs">
             gets really hectic, or while we're traveling, healthy snacks on the go are realky important. It's a convenience
             <br class="hidden-xs">
             factor, and also a matter of proactively providing yourself a healthy alternative before you're starving and 
             <br class="hidden-xs">
             considering eating anything that can't outrun you (that might just be me, projecting).

                 I don't know about you guys but I'm Picky when it comes to commercially prepared <a href="#" class="demi">healthy snacks</a>. Packing
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  fruits and veggies and even your own meals is smart and can even end up saving you money, but sometimes
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  you just need to be able to grab something and go. But when it comes to health snacks and meal replacement
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  bars, a lot of them have... a taste. Some kind of weird, awful taste that just lingers. Do you guys know what I'm 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  talking about? As in, the snack almost tastes like the wrapper it came in? And it's not just the taste; I also care
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   about what's in the food that I eat. And a lot of the meal bars and foods that pose as healthy snacks actually
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   have a lot of ingredients that aren't at all healthy or natural. I like simple ingredients. Organic is ideal. Even
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   better if it's made by a company operating with good ethos. The snacks should also be relatively filling, so

                   you're not hungry again in 10 minutes.

                  Long story short, as I said before - I'm a bit picky when it comes to convenient healthy snacks. I want my food
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   to taste good. Great actually. I like to enjoy what I'm eating. So after many years of deperately searching for
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    flight snacks and in-between meal grabs and sometimes just general munchies, here's our list of favorite
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    healthy on the go snacks that have passed a high standard for both taste and ingredients. Some of these are

                     so tasty that we eat them for "dessert"!

                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 They're made local to us in Washington state but have recently started to pop up all over. We've eaten them for
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  years and they're great for mornings when you know you need a little substance but don't have time to stop
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  and make yourself breakfast. These also come in chocolate, and a number of other flavors. They also make

                  smaller <a href="#" class="demi">chocolate brownie muffins</a> (the ones I've linked here are choclate & cherry) that we eat as dessert
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   around out house. They're still made from simple ingredients but so dangerously delicious that you're going to
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   want to taste at your own risk - just don't eat the whole dozen all at once! They are soft and have a very

                   doughy texture. plus, can you go wrong with chocolate? Now I'm hungry.

                 between meals. They're organic, with no artificial ingredients, colors, flavors, or preservatives. The only

                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  the Umchu bars is the coconut cocoa nibs. There are only threee ingredients; unsweetened coconut, cocoa
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  nibs, and brown rice sugar. You shouldn't make a habit of eating a large quantity of coconut (due to the 
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   saturated fat) but otherwise, these natural minimalist bars are filling and very tasty.

                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                  probably my favorite. You can see many of the ingredients of these bars right throught the package. They tend

                   to be compromised of a variety of nuts, seeds, and fruits. These are pretty easy to find at most grocery stores and

                  even some convenience shops.

                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  between meals, and even replace a small meal (especially if accompained by a piece of fruit). These are whole

                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  these are my favorites. One of my friends teased me for eating prunes but I made her try them. Later she called
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  me and admitted that she had been hooked on them since. They are delicious. Soft and sweet and again, the

                  only ingredient is prunes,. They offer fiber, vitamins and a good boost of carbs to help keep hunger at bay until

                  you're ready for your next meal. Don't let the idea of it being prunes weird you out; these things are tasty! They

                   even passed the taste test of my 6 year old niece (a feat).

                 <a href="#" class="demi">Moon Cheese</a> - I know cheese doesn't necessarily fit the bill of a health food, and some prefer to go dairy free,
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 but for the cheese lovers out there with the need for a quick snack, these taste great. One of my good friends
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 share some with me on a hike and I had to work hard to not steal the rest from him. The ingredients are
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  minimal; it's really just cheese (that doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be easily shoved into a travel bag).
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  It's a good source of protein and calcuim. If you're trying to watch your carbohydrate intake, these are also a
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   great low carb snack idea. Moon Cheese is another company that's local to me, so I'm not sure how easily it
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   would be able to find in stores, but it is available online.

                  vegan. They also do a sweet potato and beet mix that I love. If you're looking for a good crunchy snack, you've 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  got to try these.

                  <a href="#" class="demi">Justin's Honey Peanut Butter Packs</a> - I always pack these in my travel bag! I love that they provide filling fat

                  and protein, with honey for a little kick of carbs. They also have options that are jst the nut butter, if you want
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  to cut out the honey. Great for stalling hunger when you're just not able to eat a good sit down meal right away.

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  Nuts - Almonds, cashews, walnuts, brazil nuts, pistachois - nuts are a great to-go snack and very easy to pack.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   These are easy to find in just about any grocery store; you can buy in bulk and portion it out for yourself (which
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     will likely save you money) or buy smaller portions that allow you to just grab and go. Nuts are very calorie
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     dense, so you'll want to be mindful of seving size, but they each offer different flavours, textures and nutrients.

                  in bulk. Not only are these great in a time crunch, they also make tasty toppings for salads and the like. You can
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   also make homemade salad dressings using ground seeds, herbs, and olive oil (you can even get creative and

                   try mixtures with other healthy ingredients you've got in the kitchen).
