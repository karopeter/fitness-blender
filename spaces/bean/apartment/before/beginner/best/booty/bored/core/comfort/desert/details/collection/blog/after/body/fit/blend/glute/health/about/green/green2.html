                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 is through fried rice dishes - well, pseudo-fried rice , in which the rice is cooked and stirred in with all
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  of the other ingredients just before serving, rather than frying it in oil. We also like to use brown, black of wild
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   rice to ensure we reap the benefits that whole grains brings to the table. If you use good produce, fresh herbs
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  and a bit of chili sauce, you'll find this recipe packs as much flavor as the traditional dish, but without the

                  unnecessary calories and added fat.

                   healthy meal that you can realistically prepare from start to finish after a day's work. Moreover, the recipe can

                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    Try some small cubes of eggplant or little cauliflower. As with most recipes, the use of real quality

                   To balance out the savory elements of soy sauce, seasame oil and unmami-packed vegetables, this recipe
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    incorporates sweet chunks of pineapple, which are slightly acidic, but become caramelized and sugary once

                  <p class="long-copy">
                   The key to a good fried rice is cooking the dis quickly -  a burst of high heat gives the veggies a deep smoky
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    flavor. Any more than that and they'll become limp; soggy and plae in color. For this reason, it's very important 
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    that you let all of your ingredients dry after washing so they don't steam.

                   The added benefit of this flash cooking technique is that it keeps the vegetables fairly intact in their natural

                    from; in fact, you are barely cooking them at all. This way, they retain many more nutrients and fiber than they
