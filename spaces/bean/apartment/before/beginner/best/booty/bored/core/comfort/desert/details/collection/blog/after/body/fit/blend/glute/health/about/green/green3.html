               <br class="hidden-xs">
                a commercial brand many of us recall from childhood. Pure maple syrup is exactly what it sounds like
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 - no additives, coloring, or corn syrup - just the natural stuff that comes from the sap of maple trees.

                 There is a big difference between this and the artificial version, so make sure to look for the word "pure" on
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  the packaging. Most of the maple syrup you come across will be form Vermont or Canada. It can come in
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  different grades, hues and tastes, but as long as it is pure, it is natural and unadulterated.

                  Maple syrupp is a great weapon in the kitchen, for baking and breakfast as well as savory cooking. It brings a
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  wonderful sweetness to dishes, from dressings and glazes, to marinades and sauces. Anywhere you might use
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  sugar, honey or agave, try using maple syrup. Some people even opt for maple syrup instead of sugar in their

                  Not only does pure maple syrup taste better than its artificial counterpart, it is also (no surprise) much better
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   for you, as many of these artificial versions are made with corn syrup. Maple syrup is also lower in calories than
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   many other sweeteners, and is a great source of maganese, which is vital to brain and nerve functions. It is
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   also rich in vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, potassium and calcium. There is ongoing research that
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    shows just how beneficial this ingredient may be, so it's a great choice when it comes to natural sweeteners.

                  In addition to maple syrup, this dish packs plenty of health benefits from carrots. Carrots are low in fat and
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  cholesterol and are rich in vitamins including Vitamin A (which is important for our vision), Vitamin K, Vitamin B6,

                  Vitamin C and Vitamin E, as well as maganese, thiamin and potassium. Carrots are also high in fiber. Related:
