               <p class="long-copy">
                I love a lot about this meal plan! It's laid out fantastically and I found it
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 easy to adapt to a family of 4. The meals are straight forward and
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 contain a good variety. I was a little disapointed that it's not fully
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 vegan since it has honey and greek yogurt as part of the meal plan.
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 Honey is derived form bees in a way that is detrimental to the bees so
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 it's a little jarring to have to alter the meal plan several times to
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 accomodate for this. Greek yogurt is milk derived and horrendously
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 terrible for the enviroment. Beside the non-vegan flaws, it's still an
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 amazing meal plan and I would recommend it to anyome looking for a
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 meal plan to get to know what healthy eating looks like. if this were
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 ever adapted, I would also recommend less use tofu. Soy is a
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 common allergy and also not good for the enviroment which is a big 
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 deal to many vegans. The health aspects of consuming large quantities
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 of soy also questionable. I adapted to using beans for a lot more of
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 the recipes.

                 What I love most about this vegan meal plan is that the ingredients and recipes
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 are very straightforward and manageable. It comes with a lot of supplementary
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  reading material; so much that it might be too much, but I reckon it's better to
                  <br class="hiddem-xs">
                  err on the side of lots of information, than not enough. I would call this plan "kid
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  friendly". It helps that my son is already a kid who like tofu, avocados, whole

                  grain bread and tortillas, some vegetables, nuts, and fruit, but there is a fair bit

                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 plan; at least the grocery list, "kid friendly". It's relaxing to know that so long as I
