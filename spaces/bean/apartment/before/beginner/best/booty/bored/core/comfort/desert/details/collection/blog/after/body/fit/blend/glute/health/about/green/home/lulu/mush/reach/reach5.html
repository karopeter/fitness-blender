                This detailed, day-by-day, has been meticulously built by the Fitness Blender team to increase muscle
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 mass quickly and effextively. By properly cycling muscle groups and training styles this program will help
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  you safely and efficiently train 5 days a week to get the most size and/strength gains in as little time as
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  possible. We have even included a section on how to make modifications to this program to focus on your
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  specific goals; mass building, strength gains, intense muscle toning or a combination of each. We also
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  include a "Guide to Clean Eating" that gives you a general but incredibly effective rundown on how to eat during
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  this program for better health & faster results (please note, this is a general guide and not a <a href="#" class="demi">meal plan</a>). Each
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  day you get a calorie burn and workout time estimate to help you plan your day. The vast majority of fitness
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  levels have been able to partake in these programs as you are encouraged to go at your own pace and select
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  weight that is appropriate for you. The only equipment you will need is a set of dumbbells and an optional
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  exercise bench (most of theses exercises can easily be modified to be done with out one). We have also
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  included optional 6th day stretch routine to keep you from losiong flexibility and range of motion which is often a 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  problem with many strength routines. If you are looking to build size and strength you won't be disappointed
