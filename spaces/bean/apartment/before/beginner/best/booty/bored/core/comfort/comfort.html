                 Like <a href="#" class="demi">sweet potatoes</a>, regular potatoes are relatively low in calories (about 100 calories for a small spud). They
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  are also loaded with potassium and iron, and are a good source of fiber, especially when eaten with the skins
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   on. In this recipe, we've peeled the potatoes to ensure a smooth and creamy texture to the soup, but you
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   could certainly leave the skins on for a more rustic version of the dish. If you do leave the skins on, make sure
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   to give them a good scrub and cut out any blemishes. If possible, seek out organic or locally grown potato
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   varieties, as these may be less likely to have been sprayed with potentially harmful chemicals.

                  As mentioned, this recipe is super smooth and creamy, yet that doesn't mean it is unhealthy. Thanks to starchy

                   potatoes and a strong flavor base of mixed vegetables and spices, this soup doesn't need a ton of fat to

                  acheive the comfort food checkmark.

                  Another favorite comfort soup: <a href="#" class="demi">Protein-Packed Vegan Chili</a>

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  Becuase of this, we've used just a little bit of whole milk at the end of cooking instead of the usual heavy
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   cream. Still incorporate some delicious savory meat into the dish, such as bacon, which pairs wonderfully with
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    potatoes. You don't need to use very much bacon to obtain great flavor. In fact, we've used just three strips for
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     the whole pot of soup. If you want to cut down on that small amount of bacon fat(as well as cooking time and
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     clean up), you can cook the bacon strips between paper towels in the microwave, break it into pieces and add
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     it to the soup. If you prefer smoked ham in your potato soup instead of bacon, simply swap in some cubed ham
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     before serving.

                  with the potatoes. No matter how you cook it up, remeber that healthy eating is about moderation, variety,
