               <strong>Overview</strong>
               <br class="hidden-xs">
                This is NOT your typical abs program and this plan is not just a bunch of repitions of core exercises. We built
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                this program for results, and the combination of core, HIIT cardio, strength training is not only great for
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 building a lean, tones stomach or six pack, it's also effective for allover toning, reducing body
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  fat, improving cardiovascular endurance, increasing lean muscle mass, functional strength, agility, coordination,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  flexibility and balance. With these workouts and a healthy diet, you can definitely see drops in body fat and
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   scale weight.

               <p class="long-copy">
                 A heavy emphasis on the abs, obliques and lower back, combined with HIIT and total body strength training,
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  helps lower body fat, flatten, tone and define the midsection. The carefully constructed day by day plan uses
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   our full length workout videos to weave total body strength and toning routines and varying intensities of body
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   fat reducing cardio in with a blend of dynamic abdominal exercises to not only tone up those muscles that are
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   residing underneath any excess body fat, but also to burn off the fat layer they're hiding under so that you can
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   see the product of all your hard work. The program also aims to build a stronger core which will benefit you,
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   your fitness goals, & your quality of life in ways far beyound the superficial goal of a flatter stomach.

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  Workouts are scheduled five days a week (three weekly core intensive workouts, roughly every other day), and
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  average out to 31 minutes a day. Dumbbells are used throughout the program & are recommended but not
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 absolutely necessary & you can always improvise. There are almost no repeat workouts in this program; you do
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 a different workout video almost every day. As an added bonus, your core is not the only muscle group that's
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 being targeted; with the very dynamic exercises found in these workouts, you are likely to see rapid changes in
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 your belly fat and tone, as well as in the rest of your body. Make sure to take "before and after" photos so that
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 you can see the difference in 4 weeks!

                  <strong>Combining this plan with other programs:</strong> This program have five scheduled workouts a week, three of which
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  intensively target the core (typically days 1,3 & 5 of each week long span, labeled "Core Intensive"). This
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  leaves you with 2-3 days a week to train other parts of your body. This program fills those days with a 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 combination of strength training and/or various types of cardio (the most effective training types for reducing
                  <br class="hidden-xs">  
                    body fat), meaning that you can use this as a standalone program, however, if you want to combine this
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    program with another one of our plans targeting another training goal or muscle, you have the option of doing

                     only the 3 "Core Intensive" workouts a week and combining this program with our other programs. You will not

                     need or want to do any additional workouts targeting the core (extra workouts for these muscle groups may

                     actually hinder your progress - it's a myth that you should work your abs every day). It takes a lot of self-
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    directing and listening to your own body, but you can pair this with another Fitness Blender Program, just keep
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    in mind that our more intensive plans with heavy emphasis on strength training and HIIT may be overkill in
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    combination with this program, unless they are modified. As mentioned above, you could use just the core

                    intensive portion of this program (typically days 1, 3 & 5 of each week) to completely burnout your abdominals,
