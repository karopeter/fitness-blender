                 In this routine we use some traditional exercises that you have probably seen before from Fitness Blender, but

                 some of them are slight variations with a bit more challenging movement combinations. If you come across an

                  exercise that haven't seen before, be sure to take the first few reptitions slowly until you know your

                   body will handle it.  Sometimes exercises that seem easy can pose a greater risk due to balance or coordination

                   demands rather than strength.

               <p class="long-copy">
                As with most HIIT-style exercises, these are all ballistic in nature, which means quick explosive movements.
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 Though these movements are fine for most healthy and physically-active individuals, you may need to modify
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 them be to be slightky less dynamic or high impact. We have included some options on ways to make these

                if you are planning on using this workout as an add-on to another routine, be sure to keep in mind your energy

                levels. As you get more tired, balance and coordinatiin start to fail. And because HIIT exercise typically

                demand a lot from both balance and coordination, you need to be sure that you still have enough energy at
