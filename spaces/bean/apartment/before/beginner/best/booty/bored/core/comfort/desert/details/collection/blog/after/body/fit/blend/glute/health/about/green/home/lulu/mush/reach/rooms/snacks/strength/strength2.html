             For the longest time I avoided upper body strength training. A long time age, I felt like strength training was a

             waste of time - especially for the upper body. It did't leave me huffing and puffing and dripping sweat like

             leading to weight loss. <a href="#" class="demi">In my teens and very early twenties</a>, all I cared about in terms of fitness was being

             "smaller" and weighing less. How exciting! What an empty, utterly soul-sucking, life-draining goal.

                 But seriously. The value of this incredible, life-changing, health-improving training was lost on me because I
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 didn't see it as being directly correlated with an incredibly narrow-minded, one-track goal (being thinner). Now
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  I know better. Now I know that here is much more to life and fitness and feeling good than weighing a certain

                  amount of fitting into a certian sixe jeans. Plus, in my youth, I was very, very good about strength training
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  being a waste of time when it comes to weight loss; lifting weights is one of the smartest, healthiest, most

                  Regardless of what body part you may view as a "problem area" - a term I wouldn't mind seeing dying off, by
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  the way - your whole body needs smart movement. Not just the parts that you've been likely taught or
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  conditioned to dislike. Your whole body needs and deserves attention and smart training; "the whole is more
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  than the sum of its parts" - I think Aristotle point applies to the physical training of the body. Our bodies aren't 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  just glutes, or cleves, biceps, or deltoids. I see so many people (and trainers, for that matter) get hyper-
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  focused on one muscle group in a way tht's just not functional. These muscles need to be able to cohesively
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  and consistently work together and alone - in unision and isolation, in random and varying combinations.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  That's why it's important that we train <a href="#" class="demi">train the whole body</a>, not just the parts that we think need improving. It's also
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  another reason that we love  variety in our training styles; <a href="#" class="demi">high intensity interval training</a>, strength training, <a href="#" class="demi">Pilates</a>,

                   Aside from my health-oriented ramble about wy you should very much csre about both strength training and
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    training your entire body, I can also give you the more superficial, surface-oriented scoop and tell you that
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    workouts like this one are strength training aren't enough to make you want to lift and lower the heavy things (hey - no
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     judging here; whatever it takes to keep all of us moving!) just think of how great your arms, shoulders, and
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     upper back will look. Strength training is metabolism-boosting, helps your body burn fat even while at rest, and
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     and it gives the body great, beautiful shape that can be put to good, functional use in every day like. It's

                  Now I love strength training. It has been my favorite way to train for over a decade now and I'm grateful for the

                  way it makes me feel. What's your story with strength training? Do you love it? Are you brand new or a veteran?

                  things are intimidating, and also that we tend to shy away from the things that make us feel "new" or
