                Being a big fan of Fitness Blender, I was quites unimpressed with this
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 meal plan. The shopping list doesn't list out how much of an ingredient
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                you need to buy, I understand why (as different people require
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 different amounts) - but this could be solved with a simple macro. The
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 measurements are all over the place - one recipe will ask for 0.5
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 medium banana, and then another recipe asks for .66 cup of banana
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 (i'm not even sure how to go about measuring up .66 cup of a 
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 banana!?). it'd be a lot easier if they used weight throughout. The PDF is
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 very basic; its not hyperlinked, there are grammar inconsistencies

                I have just purchased the omnivore plan & am reading through it.
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 I am very exicted so far, as I was hesitant to waste more money on

                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 to cook & the meal seem to be simple to prepare. I prefer to eat a
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 vegetarian diet, but my husband & sons like some meat. This meal plan
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                seems to be a nice balannce between. My shopping budget is not large.
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                Looking at the shopping list, I think I will be able to manage it.
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                Obviously I can't say for sure until I go shopping, but it doesn't seem
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                excessive. The simple layout is printer friendly. Not wasting a lot of ink
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                on unnecessary pictures. The different calorie serving amounts is
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                convenient. I know roughly a healthy serving size for each person in the

                family, by following this & can prepare adequate meals without excess.
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                Finally, I like the extra information. Eg My husband can't stand beans &
