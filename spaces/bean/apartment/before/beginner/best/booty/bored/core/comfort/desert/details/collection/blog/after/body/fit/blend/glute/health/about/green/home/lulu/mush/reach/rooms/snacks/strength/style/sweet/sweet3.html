                  which intensively target the upper body. This means that you will not want to do any additional workouts
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  targeting the upper body (extra workouts for these muscle groups may actually hinder your progress).
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   Strength workouts for the lower body and core muscles be ideal for 2 other sessions a week,
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   and activities like running, walking, swimming, hiking, biking, yoga, organized sports, low impact cardio,
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    stretching, etc, would also be great options for those 2 free days each week. <a href="#" class="demi">You can easily pair this

                     program with our 4 Week Butt & Thigh Program; FBbooty</a> or, to target the core, you can use it with our <a href="#" class="demi">4

                     Week FBabs for abs, obliques and lower back</a>. You can certainly pair with another Fitness Blender

                     Program, though our more intensive plans that target all of the muscle groups (i.e. <a href="#" class="demi">8 Week FBFit,</a> or <a href="#" class="demi">8

                     with this program because they already work the upper body.
