                  During menopause many women experience mood swing that might be accompained
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   by bouts of depression. As hormones fluctuate, brain chemistry does as well, especially when it comes to

                   serotonin. As serotonin levels start to dip lower, a women often craves sweets and feels irritable. When the

                    serotonin rises, craving will then decrease and an upbeat mood is restored. For those who are experiencing
