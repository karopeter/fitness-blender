               <bold>R</bold> isotto, a classic Italian dish with origins in the northern part of the country, is traditionally made with

                 arborio rice, a short-grained rice with a particularly starchy consistence, While the classic version is
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 always a treat, we love the versatility of risotto, which can be made with just about any grain. In particular we 
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  like to use barley, not only because this nutty grain adds complexity to the dish in terms of taste and texture,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  but also becuase of the many health benefits of the grain

               <p class="long-copy">
                Whole grain barley is loaded with fiber, especially hulled barley. However both hulled and pearled barely are
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 very rich in fiber, which helps keep blood sugar in check. In this recipe, we've used hulled barley, so the
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 cooking takes about 50 minutes. pearled barley would cook more quickly (in about 30). Barley also contains
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  selenium, an improtant trace mineral and antioxidant. By starting your risotto with such a wholesome grain, you

                 The amount of work involve with this dish is much less than you'd think. Risotto has the reputation of needing
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 a lot of attention, but in reality it just needs a few stirs now and then, and little else. The basic formula for a
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  risotto is to gently cook your onions, garlic, leeks or other vegetables in oil or butter and herbs, followed by
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  your grains. Once the grains are coates in oil, add a splash of white wine and allow it to cook off. From there,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   stock is added little by little until the grains are cooked and the liquid is mostly absorbed.

                 Risotto can be elegrant (think lobstar and saffron) or as simple as you like. Our go-to recipe is on the simpler

                 side, skipping the classic use of herbs and white wine. We've stirred in some browned mushrooms at the end
