                     Programs for the <a href="#" class="demi">upper body</a> and <a href="#" class="demi">abs/core muscles</a> would be ideal for 2 other training sessions a week, and

                    at their own pace through the workouts, the routines in this plan are relatively intense and start out at

                    difficulty levels 3-5 from day 1. This is not a low impact program (though it can be very easily modified to fit

                      low impact needs). Excersers will need to use their own discretion in manipulating the scheduled workouts
