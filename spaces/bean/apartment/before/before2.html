                 I would like to thank you for all your hard work in Fitness Blender. It hss made a huge impact in my life, both

                 I stumbled upon <a href="#" class="demi">Fitness Blender</a> in April 2016 when my weight hit a record high of 73kg (~161lb). At the time,
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 stress from school messed with my diet ad sleep, and I gain 5kg (~11lb) in just 2 months. I had always 
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 struggled with my weight as I grew up as I tried to acheive the Asian standard of beauty imposed on me, i.e.,
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 super skinny. However, I have tried many ways to lose weight, but none of them were sustainable. With the
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  weight gain in such a short amount of time, I decided that I had to do something again and I found Fitness

                   Blender.

                  I lost 13kg (~29lb) in the first 4 months, and I have continued to workout with you to since then. After 14

                   months with you, I have lost 16kg (~35lb) in total and feeling so much stronger and capable in terms of my

                  fitness. While the workout videos helped with my weight loss, <a href="#" class="demi">your philosophy on fitness</a> and healthy lifestyle
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    made a tremendous impact on me. I have come to appreciate my fitness level rather than focusing on my

                    wight. I value much more about what I can do rather than how much I weight. I also realize that my struggle

                     was not only about weight but also about my self-confidence and perception of beauty. With your help, I have

                 Living a healthy lifestyle seemed unattainable because I never had the time and motivaion to go to the gym. I
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  live in Canada, and walking 15 minutes to the gym in -20 degree Celsius (-4 F) in winter is just demotivating.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  The <a href="#" class="demi">30 minutes workout programs</a> have been both efficient and effective for me. The videos are short also

                  fun (using <a href="#" class="demi">Kelli
