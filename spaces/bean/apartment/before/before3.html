               <p class="long-copy">
                I wanted to share my fitness journey story with you! I just recently turned 35 and I've stopped and started
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                workouts and healthy eating multiple times since I was 3, but since January of this year I have managed to
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 stay on track with my healthy eating and fitness and I do not think I would have seen the progress or even kept
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 with it if it hadn't been for Fitness Blender!
               </p>

             <div class="row">
               <p class="long-copy">
                 In October of last year I had my first of 3 eye surgeries which overlapped with the second and left me with
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 restrictions limiting my activities. I am also hypothyroid, during the time I was on these restrictions,
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  unbestknownst to me my thyroid medication needed to be adjusted (I did not find out until Feburary). So due to 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   a combination of under-activity, under active thyroid, the holidays, and uninhibited eating I gained
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    approximately 17ibs putting me at the heaviest I've ever been in my life..
                 </p>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                  On January 14, I had my husband take 3 photos of me so I could document the start of my fitness journey.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  Seeing those pictures really hit home just how far I'd let myself go.
                 </p>

             <div class="row">
               <p class="long-copy">
                 So I pushed mysekf harder than I ever have in my life, determined to not only lose the weight I gained, but also
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 to get in the best shape of my life..
                 </p>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                  Today I took my 5 month photos and I am beyond elated with my progress! I did not take my measurements
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   and I didn't have much of a <a href="#" class="demi">weight goal</a>, I have been most concerned with how I look not what I weigh, but I
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    have lost 22ibs and have surpassed my goals!
