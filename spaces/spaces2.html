                  According to James O'Keefe, MD prolonged intense exercise causes excessive oxidative stress which can burn

                  through antioxidants in your system and pre-dispose you  to problems. An article by Dr. O'keefe highlighted the
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  risks of excessive endurance training. Dr. O'keefe reported that chronic intense and sustained exercise can
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 cause a variety of heart problems including atrial and ventricular arrhymias. There was found to be a 5-fold

                  increase in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in vetran endurance athletes in sports such as marathon or

                  ultramatathon running or professional cycling. It was also found that intense endurance exercise efforts often

                  cause elevation in biomarkers for myocardial injury.

                  Another common problem withrunners are musculoskeletal injuries. It has been estimated that 27% to 70% of
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   runners sustain some type of injury at one point. Highly repetitive, impactful, weight-bearimg that occurs with
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    running can cause overuse type injuries. These injuries generally occur when a structure is exposed to a large
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    number of repitive forces at the knee, lower leg or foot. Inadequate recovery time between training sessions
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    in people who participate in  excessive running can also result in an overuse injury. Repeated applied stresses
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    that are below the tensile limit of a structure lead to positive remodeling if sufficient rest time is provided

                  It may be beneficial to reduce running duration and frequency in order to decrease impact forces through the
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  lower extremity and help to decrease the risk of injury. Longer rest periods should be encouraged in order to
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  allow healing or remodeling of the tissue to occur between sessions. Proximal core hip strength is also
