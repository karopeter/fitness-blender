                small apartments. I was still mostly doing gym workouts at that point, but every now and again I
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 would tackle a workout in my apartment. That lasted until I dropped my rent off at the apartment manager's
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 office, and they asked, "Do you dance around at night...or something? Because the neighbors downstairs are

                  quiet time without the pounding of someone's feet overhead. That's fair. But it also seems a fair objective to

                   Lifting is a great option for apartment workouts because they don't require any jumping; you can get in a great

                  workout that builds muscle and makes you sweat, with almost no impact. All you need is a set of dumbbells or

                  resistance bands and an optional exercise mat. I favor dumbbells, but resistance bands are cheaper and take
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   up even less space. In terms of dumbbells, <a href="#" class="demi">these adjustable PowerBlocks</a> are spendy, but are well built and

                    take up very little room (because of the way they fit together, the entire set has the footprint of a single large
