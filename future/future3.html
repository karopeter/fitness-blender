                  <strong>Carbohydrated First</strong>
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    When it comes to fueling your body, it is important to incorporate all three <a href="#" class="demi">macronutrients</a>, however one is
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    most important. When it comes to long distance running it is carbohydrates that serve as the main source of
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    fuel. It is most important to opt for complex carbohydrates over simple sugars, as they are digested more

                     slowly, give you longer lasting energy. They will be used as fuel, and will replenish and maintain
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     glycogen stores. Carbohydrates should provide about 60-70% of total calorie whil training for an endurance
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     sport. The recommendation for a marathon runner is about 7 to 10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     weight during the period. These complex carbohydrates include foods like whole grain bread and
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     pasta, cereal, brown rice, oatmeal, vegetables and low fat dairy foods.

                  <strong>Protein And Fats</strong>
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   The other tow macronutrients, protein and fat, should both also be part of a balanced diet. It is important to
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   consider the fact that protein is needed for muscle growth and repair, while fat has been shown to improve
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   endurance. In general a person, who is not training, needs about .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                   weight. When training the recommedation goes up to about 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    Protein should make up about 15% of total calories per day. Without enough protein while training, the body
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     will break down muscle to fult the body when running long distances. With the right amount of protein in the
