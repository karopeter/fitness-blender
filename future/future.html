                   health and fitness but mind has been pretty sloppy over the last month (I had a birthday, traveled a lot, and did

                    a lot of fun stuff with good friends). Still, I saw a difference in my body compistion (I have no idea about

                     patience, so I want to at least try and do the same for out FBfamily. My main message is; never panic. Try to be

                  Honestly, I would recommend not even focusing on "the results". Focus on the work. Focus on showing up and
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  pushing yourself through your workouts. Focus on making the right food decisions, for good health. Forget
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  about results at all, just focus on doing the best that you can every day - knowing that there will inevitably be
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  some "off days" or days where you stumble, and then one day "the results" will smack you in the face, due to
