                   too agressive in their training, way too soon. Take time to build a strong base for yourself; if you go 110% right

                  how fit someone else is, or where you think you should be, you have to be willing to start where your body

                   progress. Come across an exercise interval that's too hard? Jog in place until it's over. Really struggling and

                    need a break even though the  interval is not over? Take a couple seconds to rest & recoup before you push
