                 <p class="long-copy">
                  My goal is with this article and sort of confessional vlog is to encourage you that health and fitness are within
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 your reach, and it does not necessarily require a brutal, extreme makeover of your habits. In fact, those <a href="#" class="demi">strict
                   <br class="hidden-xs">  
                    habits may end up harming your body</a> or at least hindering progress towards your goals. You don't have to
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     spend time counting, tracking, calculating, weighing, measuring, entering data, etc. Life doesn't have to be like
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     that, and that's not necessarily what good health looks like.

                  You absolutely can be fit/lean/healthy and not have your entire life revolve around the habits it takes to get
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  there or maintain those results. That is my message with this article; strive for it, because it's entirely within

                  your reach, and it doesn't have to take over your life.

                 a totalitarian mindset where you only promote the concept of perfection; it's just not realistic and I think it can

                 be alienating and actually set people up for unhealthy relationships with food and exercise. I think the "all or

                 nothing" approaches are part of what keep so many people away from trying out healthy habits at all.
