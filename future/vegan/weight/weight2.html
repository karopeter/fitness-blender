                <br class="hidden-xs">
                is all about calorie in and calories out. Slowly but surely you start to take in less and less calories, and increase

                the time spent working out. As you jump on the scale, it is baffling why your body doens't seem to want to

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  What actually is happening is related to your meabolism regulating hormones. As you take in less and less,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  your body's hormones, such as thyroid and leptin, begin to drop in an effort to create homeostasis in the body.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  At the same time the muscle tissue begins to break down and be used for energy (which will lead to an even

                    slower, more depressed metabolism).

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  At the same time, as your body gets used to eating less calories, it also adapts to the increase in exercise. And 
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   over time it will expend fewer calories to do the same amount of physical activity. More time exercising will

                 <p class="long-copy">
                  As you can imagine, this slowing of your metabolism can turn into a vicious cycle. What happens is you wind
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  up eating fewer and fewer calories, while increasing the hours spent exercising as a way to lose weight and 
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 maintain that lower number. This cycle is one that eventually peters out as you get tired, run down or give up

                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    Cardio workouts should be considered secondary and can be added in as part of the 3-4 day regimen, but a

                   <strong>Fixing a damaged metabolism: Eating habits</strong>
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    The next step is look at your caloric intake, and be prepared to increase this slowly. It is important to take
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     this slow as to not gain weight back to rapidly, which will discourage you and may lead to another cycle of

                     restricting your intake. Try to calculate how mant calories you are taking in and add about 50-100 calories a
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     week. The goal will be to have added about 500 calories after the course of a few weeks. As your body starts
                     <br class="hidden-xs">
                     to be fed correctly, but resist the temptation to over exercise and decrease your calories. The goal is to feed your

                     body enough to allow your hormones to start to work efficiently once again. The thyroid hormones will

                     increase, leptin levels will no longer think you are in starvation mode and muscle tissue will increase.

                  It is also important to keep mixing things up. For your body to continue to work efficiently it is important to
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  "keep it guessing". This can be achieved by changing up your exercise routine every so often and varying the

                  foods you are opting to eat. These both will ensure that your body's metabolism is fed, working hard and

                  restored. Lastly, it is important to recognize that losing weight should not be a race, take your time and
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  understand that weight that is lost more slowly is more likely to stay off for good.
