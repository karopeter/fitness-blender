                <bold>I</bold> ncorporating seafood into your diet is a great health-conscious choice you can make, yet when it comes
                <br class="hidden-xs">
                 to fish, people tend to shy away from making it at home, aving it for a special night out at a resturant.
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                  Maybe this is fair for lobster anc octopus, but in reality, whole or filleted fish is an absoulte breeze to prepare,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  and unline a lot of protein, take very little time to prepare. In fact, when cooking with fish, you can get home
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  from work and have a mouthwatering, wholesome dinner on the table in well under 30 minutes.

                  If you're new to cooking fish at home, salmon is a great place to start, not only because it will please those
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   who aren't keen on very "fishy" flavors, but also because salmon is chock full of healthy nutrients - there's a 
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    reason it's known as "brain food!"
                 </p>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                  To begin with, oily fish like salmon, fresh tuna, mackerel and sardines are packed with omega-3 fatty acids,
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  specifically EPA and DHA, which we need but cannot produce ourselves, and thus must get them through diet.
                 </p>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                  There is a good reason why health professionals sing the praises of omega-3 fatty acids obtained through fish.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                   Research has shown they aid in brain function and may reduce risk factors of heart disease (high cholesterol
                   <br class="hidden-xs">
                    and blood presire), certain cancers and chromic diseases including depression, Alzheimer's diabetes,
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                    multiple sclerosis and arthritis, to name only a few. These fatty acids also help keep your skin, hair and nails
                    <br class="hidden-xs">
                     shiny.
                 </p>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                  Beyond the extensive health benefits that come from salmon's Omega-3s, the fish is also a good source of
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  vitamin D, which helps protect against macular degeneration, as well as Vitamin B12, potassium and selenium.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  As a high-quality protein with plenty of nutrients, you should aim to get this all-start ingredient (or other oily fish)
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  into your diet 2-3 times a week.

                  One thing to note - is it important to seek out wild salmon, ideally from Alaska, not only for sustainability
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  reasons, but also to aviod too much mecury, Wild salmon also tends to be lower in fat and higher in nutrients.
                  <br class="hidden-xs">

                   roasting the salmon fillets with whole rosemary rather than chopped, the fish takes on a subtle aroma of the
