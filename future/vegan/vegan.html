                 We've used Adzuki beans for this dish, but really any kind of bean will do. Adzuki beans, with their high content

                  If you're exercising regularly, and particularly if you're lifiting weights, the high protein in adzuki beans

                  Quinoa is a great little super-grain to supply you with more fiber (almost twice as much as other grains), as well
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                  as incredible protein, since it is a complete protein which has all nine of the essential amino acids that our body
                  <br class="hidden-xs">
                 needs for good health. It is also high in iron, lysine (for tissue growth and repair), magnesium, riboflavin and
                 <br class="hidden-xs">
                 manganese. Important to know is that quinoa is also gluten-free. It's a wonderfully versatile food, and it adds a

                  lovely texture to this chili dish.
